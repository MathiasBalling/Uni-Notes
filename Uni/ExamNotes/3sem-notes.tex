Considerations for next time:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Presentation needs to be more organised and provide a quick overview. Videos work great. 
Someone that hasn't seen the report should know what is going on. 
\item When writing the report a lot of effort should be put into testing and precisely describe why things work and why things doesn't.
\item Find the cause of a problem, not just the effect.
\item Structure the report/testing after the subproblems
\end{enumerate}

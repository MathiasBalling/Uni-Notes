\textbf{VHDL Design Units}


\textbf{Entity}

The entity describes how the unit interfaces with the outside world.
The entity lists the various inputs and outputs of the underlying system.

\textbf{Architecture}

Describes what the circuit actually does. It describes the internal
implementation of the associated entity.

\textbf{Karnaugh map (K-map)}
A method of circuit optimization. Aims to reduce logic functions
more quickly and easily compared to Boolean algebra.

\textbf{Combinational circuits}

\textbf{Sequential circuits}


$$C <= not(A);$$

This line means that C is assigned with the value of not A.

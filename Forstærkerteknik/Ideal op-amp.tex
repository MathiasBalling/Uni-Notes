\section{Ideal op-amp}

The common-mode signal $v_{icm}$ is the average of the input voltages and given by:
$$v_{icm} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{2}$$

The differential signal is the difference between the input voltages and given by:
$$v_{id} = v_1 - v_2$$

An opertional amplifier (op-amp) is an idealized amplifier with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Infinite input impedance}
	\item{Infinite open-loop gain $A_OL$ for the differential signal}
	\item{Zero gain for the common-mode signal}
	\item{Zero output impedance}
	\item{Infinite bandwidth}
\end{itemize}

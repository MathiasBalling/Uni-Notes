\section{Op-amps}

The common-mode signal $v_{icm}$ is the average of the input voltages and given by:
$$v_{icm} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{2}$$

The differential signal is the difference between the input voltages and given by:
$$v_{id} = v_1 - v_2$$

An opertional amplifier (op-amp) is an idealized amplifier with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Infinite input impedance}
	\item{Infinite open-loop gain $A_OL$ for the differential signal}
	\item{Zero gain for the common-mode signal}
	\item{Zero output impedance}
	\item{Infinite bandwidth}
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Slewrate}

The slewrate is the maximum rate of change of the output voltage and is given by:
$$| \frac{dv_{out}}{dt}| <= SR$$

\textbf{Full power bandwidth}

The full power bandwidth of an op amp is
the range of frequencies for which the op amp can produce an
undistorted sinusoidal output with peak amplitude equall to the guaranteed
maximum output voltage.

The full power bandwidth is given by:
$$f_{FP} = \frac{SR}{2\pi V_{o max}}$$

\begin{itemize}
	\item {Explain the special demands that embedded systems place on software, and how to meet
	      those demands by using the programming language: C.}
	      \item{Analyze specifications of I/O-devices, and design high performance, hardware-near programs for these}
	\item Evaluate real-time conditions in an embedded system
	\item Explain principles and algorithms for central parts of operating systems
	\item Design functions to a real-time operating system
\end{itemize}


\textbf{What is embedded programming?}

Programming of embedded systems. An embedded system is a computer system -
a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices -
that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.
An example of an embedded system is a pacemaker.


\textbf{Why is embedded programming important?}

It is important because it is used in many devices that we use in our everyday life.
For instance in cars, airplanes, household appliances, and medical equipment.


\textbf{What are the differences between a microcontroller and a microprocessor?}

A microcontroller is a single chip that contains a processor (CPU), memory, and I/O peripherals.
Where a microprocessor is a single chip that contains only a CPU.

\section{State machines}

A state machine is a computational model that is used as an
abstract machine which can be in only one state at a time.
There are two representations of state machines, Mealy and Moore.

Moore machines have outputs that depend only on the current state.

Mealy machines have outputs that depend on the current state and the current input.

Playback Robot: A human operator performs the task manually by teaching the Robot

Numerical Control Robot: The operator supplies the movement program rather than teaching the task manually.

Intelligent Robot: A robot with the means to understand its environment and the ability to successfully complete a task despite changes to the environment.

\section{Linear Time Invariant Systems}

\textbf{Linear Map} \newline
The map $f: R^n -> R^m$ is said to be linear if for any $x,y \epsilon R^n$ and
$\alpha \epsilon R$, the following conditions hold

$$f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)  \qquad \text{Super position}$$
$$f(ax) = \alpha f(x) \qquad \text{Homogeneity}$$

The function has to go through (0,0) in 2D for it to be linear due to homogeneity.


\textbf{Time-Invariant System} \newline
% Mathias kan du evt. spotte fejlen på de to næste linjer?
% Let $\sigma: R x R^m -> R^p$ define the input-output behavior of a system model $\SUM$.
% The system $\SUM$ is time-invariant if for any input signal $u:R->R^m$ \newline
and any delay $\tau \epsilon R$ the following relation holds:
$$ y(t-\tau)= \sigma(t,u(t-\tau))$$
for all times $t\epsilon R$, where $y$ denotes the output signal of the system.

The importance is that the system does not change its behavior due to time.
This can be seen as a canon firing at 8am it will not fire different
compared to if you do the same at 5pm.

\subsection{Time-Domain models}

Two types of linear time-domain models. \newline
Continous-time state space models
(based on differential equations)
$$\dot{x} = Ax+Bu$$
$$y=Cx+Du$$
\begin{itemize}
	\item x = state
	\item u = input
	\item y = output
	\item A = system matrix
	\item B = input matrix
	\item C = output matrix
	\item D = Direct feedtrhough matrix
\end{itemize}
Discrete-time state space models (based on difference equations)
$$x_{k+1} = \Phi x_k + \Gamma u_k$$
$$y_k = Cx_k + Du_k$$
